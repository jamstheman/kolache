# the server will need to monitor the incoming pings to see if the special sequence of icmp echo-request size
# matches the predefined sequence

# this still needs some work...basic concept

#!/bin/sh
tcpdump -i eth0 'icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo' > cut -c 92-94

# will probably need to send output to a pipe vs a file as it needs to be timely
